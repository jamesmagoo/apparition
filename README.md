# Apparition
### v1
An app where uses share their visions ('apparitions') of a song and what they see/feel/hear/imagine when they listen to it.

### v2
An app where users create apparitions - a poem, a blog post, a limerick, a piece of art - and show it to the world. Apparitions are ephemeral, they only last as long as people see them - unless so many people see them that they become real.
